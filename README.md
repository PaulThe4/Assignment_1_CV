# Assignment_1_CV

This repository contains solutions to a set of questions related to Assignment 1. 
Each assignment is named according to the problem it is solving and includes corresponding Python scripts for implementation.
There are some extra codes which I used for reference. For eg. to select pixel coordinates of interest I had a small script for it which I attached as well.
